## Usage

The main part of the code is located inside the "scrapers" folder.

Data was collected mainly from three sources:
- Vivoscuola
- Google Reviews
- University of Trento's Digital University

Inside each specific folder, there will be a notebook that collects data, and another notebook that processes it.
